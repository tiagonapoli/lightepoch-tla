# Memory-ordering issues found by the herd7 pass

Findings from checking the **actual instructions RyuJIT emits** for
`LightEpoch` against the vendors' own architecture memory models. Raw dumps are
in `jit/`, the reduction is accounted for in `REDUCTION.md`, and the protocol
each test encodes is described in `MODEL.md`.

Both dumps were taken with .NET 10.0.100, `DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0`
(FullOpts), `DOTNET_JitDisasmDiffable=1`:

- **x86-64** — Windows, RyuJIT `BLENDED_CODE for generic X64 + VEX`.
- **AArch64** — Ubuntu 24.04 on Azure `Standard_D8ps_v5` (Ampere Altra),
  RyuJIT `BLENDED_CODE for generic ARM64 on Unix`.

Reproduce with `docker run --rm lightepoch-herd`.

Throughout, **`main`** means the unfixed baseline `LightEpoch` — what Garnet
ships today, and what `src/LightEpoch.Implementations` reproduces as the
unfixed arm — and **fixed** means the CAS-carried announce with the
acquire-load refresh.

## x86-64

### X1 — The announce store can be buffered past the reclaimer's scan (BUG, fixed)

**Status:** present on `origin/main`; closed by the fix.
**Test:** `litmus/x86-announce-sb-main.litmus` → `Sometimes` (violated),
`litmus/x86-announce-sb-fixed.litmus` → `Never`.

`Acquire()` on `main` claims the slot with a locked RMW on the wrong word and
then announces with a plain store:

```asm
lock cmpxchg dword ptr [TID], edx      ; claim: full barrier, but on threadId
mov      rax, qword ptr [CUR]
mov      qword ptr [LCE], rax          ; the announce: PLAIN store
...
                                       ; nothing between here and the first
                                       ; load of the object being protected
```

x86-TSO lets that store sit in the store buffer while the same core's
subsequent loads complete. The reclaimer is already fenced on its side — the
`lock xadd` of `BumpCurrentEpoch` sits between its unlink store and its table
scan — but store buffering needs a barrier on *both* sides, so the reader's
missing half is enough. The reclaimer reads the slot as `0`, concludes no
thread is protected, and frees memory the reader is about to dereference.

The fix moves the CAS onto the announce word itself:

```asm
mov      rdi, qword ptr [CUR]
lock cmpxchg qword ptr [LCE], rdi      ; claim AND announce, one locked RMW
mov      dword ptr [TID], ecx          ; plain; the slot is already ours
```

The locked RMW count is unchanged; only the word being CASed differs. herd7
confirms the cycle is then forbidden under `x86tso.cat`.

This is the same defect that `../../src/LightEpoch.Repro.Common/QuarantineLitmus.cs` reproduces on real
x86 hardware, now confirmed against Intel's architectural model rather than
only observed empirically.

### X2 — The refresh path is *not* a bug on x86 (no action)

**Test:** `litmus/x86-refresh-mp-main.litmus` → `Never`.

`ProtectAndDrain` reads `CurrentEpoch` and then reads state the bumper
published before bumping. That is message passing, which is a load-load
question, and x86-TSO does not reorder loads. `main` is already safe here.

`Volatile.Read` compiles to a plain `mov` on x86, so the fixed and unfixed
`ProtectAndDrain` are **byte-identical** — 152 bytes of code each, instruction
for instruction. This is the codegen-level confirmation that the acquire load
costs nothing on x86.

### X3 — No issue found in `Release()` on x86

`Release()` emits its two plain stores in source order in both variants. See
the correction note at the end of this file.

---

## AArch64

### A1 — The same announce store-buffering bug (BUG, fixed)

**Status:** present on `origin/main`; closed by the fix.
**Test:** `litmus/arm64-announce-sb-main.litmus` → `Sometimes` (violated),
`litmus/arm64-announce-sb-fixed.litmus` → `Never`.

Identical in shape to X1. The AArch64 codegen makes the two words involved very
explicit, because the claim CAS changes width as well as target:

| | `main` | fixed |
|---|---|---|
| claim | `casal w2, w1, [TID]` (32-bit, threadId) | `casal x2, x21, [LCE]` (64-bit, localCurrentEpoch) |
| announce | `str x0, [LCE]` — plain | *(carried by the CAS)* |
| threadId publish | *(carried by the CAS)* | `str w1, [TID]` — plain |

### A2 — `CurrentEpoch` is read by an unordered `LDP` on the refresh path (BUG, ARM-only, fixed)

**Status:** present on `origin/main`; closed by the fix. **Cannot occur on
x86.**
**Test:** `litmus/arm64-refresh-mp-main.litmus` → `Sometimes` (violated),
`litmus/arm64-refresh-mp-fixed.litmus` → `Never`.

This is a real ordering hole that x86 hardware cannot expose, so no amount of
stress testing on x86 would ever have found it.

In this repository it is not a *new* verdict — the hand-written suite in `../`
and the ARM64 hardware runs recorded in `../../README.md` already established
that the refresh path needs an acquire load. What is new is the mechanism, read
off the dump rather than reconstructed: on `main`, RyuJIT merges the read of
`CurrentEpoch` with the read of the `tableAligned` pointer into a single
load-pair:

```asm
ldp     x0, x2, [x19, #0x28]     ; tableAligned AND CurrentEpoch, one plain LDP
str     x2, [LCE]                ; re-announce
```

`LDP` is an ordinary, unordered load. Nothing prevents a later load — of state
the bumper published *before* it bumped the epoch — from being satisfied ahead
of it. The reader can therefore observe the new epoch together with stale
state.

With the fix the `LDP` disappears and the epoch read becomes an acquire load:

```asm
add     x3, x19, #48
ldapr   x3, [CUR]                ; Volatile.Read -> LDAPR (load-acquire RCpc)
str     x3, [LCE]                ; re-announce, still plain (see MODEL.md)
```

`LDAPR` is RCpc rather than RCsc, which is weaker than `LDAR` only with respect
to ordering against a prior `STLR`. For message passing it is sufficient, and
herd7 confirms the violation is forbidden under `aarch64.cat`.

### A3 — `Release()` must use a release store once the fix is in (constraint, satisfied)

**Status:** not a bug in any shipped variant; a requirement the fix introduces
and meets.
**Test:** `litmus/arm64-release-plainstore.litmus` → `Sometimes`
(counterfactual), `litmus/arm64-release-fixed.litmus` → `Never`.

Making the claim CAS target `localCurrentEpoch` also makes it the
slot-*ownership* word. `Release()` therefore has to clear `threadId` first and
hand the slot over last — and the handover must carry release ordering, or the
two clears can be observed out of order and the departing thread can erase the
`threadId` of the thread that just claimed the slot.

`Volatile.Write` emits exactly that:

```asm
str     wzr, [TID]               ; clear threadId FIRST, plain
stlr    xzr, [LCE]               ; hand the slot over, STLR
```

The counterfactual row shows the same code with a plain `STR` in place of the
`STLR` and is violated, which is what makes the `STLR` demonstrably
load-bearing rather than defensive. Note this is also why the store order is
*inverted* relative to `main`: on `main`, `threadId` is the ownership word, so
clearing `localCurrentEpoch` first is the correct order there.

---

## Correction to an earlier claim in this investigation

An earlier round of disassembly work in this study recorded that RyuJIT
**reorders the two plain stores in `main`'s `Release()`**, emitting
`localCurrentEpoch = 0` before `threadId = 0` and thereby inverting source
order.

**That was a misreading, and it is retracted.** These fresh dumps show
`main`'s source order is already `localCurrentEpoch = 0; threadId = 0`
(`LightEpoch.cs` on `origin/main`), and the JIT preserves it on both x86 and
AArch64. The fixed variant's source order is the inverse, and that is likewise
preserved. No compiler store reordering was observed anywhere in these methods
on either architecture.

The argument for the `Volatile.Write` in `Release()` does not depend on that
claim — it rests on A3 above, which is about the *hardware* being permitted to
reorder the two stores, not the compiler.

## Summary

| # | Hazard | x86-64 | AArch64 | Closed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| X1 / A1 | announce vs reclaim scan (store buffering) | **violated on main** | **violated on main** | CAS on `localCurrentEpoch` |
| X2 / A2 | refresh vs bump (message passing) | safe on main | **violated on main** | `Volatile.Read` → `LDAPR` |
| X3 / A3 | release vs next claimer | safe (TSO orders store-store) | requires a release store | `Volatile.Write` → `STLR` |

No issue was found in the fixed variant on either architecture. All ten litmus
results match their expectations.
